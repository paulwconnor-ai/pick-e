# ✅ Locus Robotics Simulation Showcase – TODO Tracker

A focused checklist of features for the simulation demo.

---

## Core Features

- [x] `CmdVel` + `DiffDrive` ECS components
- [x] LiDAR sensor via physics raycasting
- [x] Occupancy grid mapping (live update)
- [x] Reactive navigation toward open space
- [x] Simulation metrics (steps, wall hits, time, etc.)

---

## New Tasks

- [ ] Grid of **collectables** placed in accessible space
- [ ] Stats UI shows: `Collected`, `Steps`, `Collisions`, `Time`
- [ ] Robot collects them using local perception

---

## Stretch Goals

- [ ] Load level from `assets/levels/maze01.txt`
- [ ] Goal-tile marker, drive toward it
- [ ] WASM build (Trunk)
- [ ] Host via S3 + CloudFront
- [ ] Generate collider data from `map-beauty.png` (blueness)
- [ ] Beautify level rendering vs logic overlay

---

## Final Deliverables

- [ ] `README.md` (final write-up)
- [ ] CV (updated)
- [ ] Covering letter
- [ ] Public demo link
- [ ] GitHub repo ready to share
